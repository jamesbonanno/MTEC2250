jan/16

on the 1st month we/i've have been thinking on concept for our projects, just simple brainstroming
and come up with 3 ideas/concepts as well as what they do, mines were a hand crank generator, AC adapter holder, and world
peace buttion (because why not?), i grew fond of the hand crank generator for what i can do with it?. 

the next assignment was to make a powerpoint presentation on what we want to make and what it's do.
what i did was try to sell my idea of a portable hand crank, i tried to sell it as a means to help people 
who needs a battery and forget to charge it as well as a way to recharge dead batterys. it didn't go too well
it needed work and some more thought.

then was concept art, i decided to try again with the hand crank generator, and see what i can do with it, so i was thinking
like a test you strength game that you see at carnivals (see links drawen and model concept). With that in mind turn from hand
crank generator to stanima tester, and the concept became more and more clear.
