how to work it

step 1: user cranks the motor (output)

step 2: arduino reads the motor (input)

step 3: arduino turns on leds based on the input of the user (output)

user crank up the arduino, then the arduino measure the input of the user
with that the ardiuno then turns on leds that light up when the person hit
a milestone, the longer they do it the more leds light up
