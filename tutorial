in this tutorial, ill be talking about the LM35 temperature sensor, how it's work, used, setup, the progarming it with arduino, and 
the possible problems they may happen.

what does the LM35 temperature sensor do, and can do;

the LM35 temperature sensor detects the temperature of the area around it, it could operate between -55C - 150C,
and its output voltage is proportional to the celsius temperature. Examples, of what it would do and be uses for; detect the temperature of
a nearby heat sink so if it gets too hot it can turn the circuit off and protect any heat senitive compontent. This is important
for circuits like a motherboard (that will have parts on it that crate heat), circuits in close tight areas, that does not have 
good air flow to keep it cool, and areas that you want to know what the temperature is.

LM35  setup for ardiuno;

the LM35 temperature sensor setup is simple, it has 3 pins 1st pin is positive, 2nd is the output, and 3rd is the ground,(assming that 
you are looking at it from the flat side, if not swap the 1st and 3rd pin and it will be no diffent). to set this up for the ardiuno
if you know how to plug in an LED, then you know were the 1st and 3rd pin go, the 2nd, middle pin, goes into the analong pins one of your
choice (ill use A1),

LM35 code for ardiuno;

int val;
int tempPin = 1;

void setup()
{
Serial.begin(9600);
}
void loop()
{
val = analogRead(tempPin);
float mv = ( val/1024.0)*5000; 
float cel = mv/10;
float farh = (cel*9)/5 + 32;

Serial.print("TEMPRATURE = ");
Serial.print(cel);
Serial.print("*C");
Serial.println();
delay(1000);

/* uncomment this to get temperature in farenhite 
Serial.print("TEMPRATURE = ");
Serial.print(farh);
Serial.print("*F");
Serial.println();


*/
}

possible problems;

mostly the placement of it, if you want to detect something pacific i.e. heat sink, then it must be near it to read said heat sink.
