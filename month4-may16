the last month for the project, i spliced to 2 codes together, and circuitry together (see splice circuitry), with that 
i began working with the code to have it work the way i want it, problems happen but it does work to an extent, to explain
it simply, the motor turns on the analong pin (A1) and that powers the compacitor, but i have no contorl over the amount of
voltage the arduino outputs so it works but the time it take to charge the compacitor will always be the same, and thats
not what i wanted but their is only 2 weeks left all i have left is to fix as much as i can 
and fixed some of the issues with the model and reprinted it as best as the 3D printer can (not well).
