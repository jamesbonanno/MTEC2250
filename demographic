1.who is this for?
  
  1: age, demographic
    
    1. 13-25, urban
    2. 13-15, suburbs
    3. 50-80, suburbs
  
  2. whats it for?
  
    1. health, toy, tool
    
      1. this device will help people suffering from muscle antorpy, with it 
         because people sould not suffer more out of doing nothing for a few
         weeks, as a toy you can use this with kids just to have some fun
         kids will do anything to be better then another sibling or friend.
         it can be used as a tool for rehab to objectivly tell if someone is 
         getting better or worst, that info can be useful for doctors and 
         make those suffering see that they are making progress.
    
  3. when will it be used
    
    1. time,place,locations
    
      1. in urban homes and rehab centers were the data can be stored on 
         an SD card so that it can be saved, and use the check a persons
         progress, if they are getting better or worst.
         
      2. in homes minor cases of muscle antorpy, end with a person being
         bedridden, but most people hate that, so this could help them
         from it weaking your muscles and sending you to rehab. it would
         have an LCD screen to tell to how you are doing and be more compacted.
         
      3. in homes for kids as a toy, medium in size kids like big and 
         colorful with buzzers for sound, something that makes them 
         feel like they are getting a reward for just playing.
         
    2. affections by time/place

         fall it should not get damaged

        5. colorful
      
      4.rehab version
        
        1.made for inside
        2.lcd screen
        3.data put onto an SD card
        
        
    3. why does this need to exist
    
      1. people should not suffer more for just doing what to doctor saids
         when they are dealing with muscle antropy, no one wants that
         and no one needs too, it too painful to even think of going 
         thew it, or even seeing a love one have it.
      
      2. my philosophy is they everything should be in some way fun or
         enjoyable it makes life easier to live and distracts you from
         things which is why i would make a version for kids so they can
         have some fun, with it as well as work out instead of doing nothing.
