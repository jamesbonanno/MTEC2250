apr/16


i left the coding to the back of my head and focus on my modeling, i made a holder for the motor and as a 1st try it did fine
as well as the holder for the breadboard and arduino (see models ex 1-3), with that i put them together in
one print so i can have them all in one place, the 1st one took 4 hours to print and came out incomplete (see model 4), i dont
know why that happened but it did, it was i nice model for know but then. most of april was modeling and 3D printing
for me because of assignments that everyone had during class.

at the end of the month the professor found code for arduino, for it to work as a voltmeter (see code p2), and with that 
i used to find how much volts the motor gives off and use that data to charge the compacitor. but a problem started to show up
how do i combine both circuits together? so to fix that i followed both circuits removed what was not needed, and it does work,
it was not as hard as i thought.
