apr/16


i left the coding to the back of my head and focus on my modeling, i made a holder for the motor and as a 1st try it did fine
as well as the holder for the breadboard and arduino (see models ex 1-3), with that i put them together in
one print so i can have them all in one place, the 1st one took 4 hours to print and came out incomplete (see model 4), i dont
know why that happened but it did, it was i nice model for know but then. most of april was modeling and 3D printing
for me because of assignments that everyone had during class.
